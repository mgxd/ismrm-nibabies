### *NiBabies* builds off the *fMRIPrep* success story
* Same philosophy: Easy-to-use, transparent, and robust.
* Impose minimal requirements
  * but will leverage add-ons if present (SDC, STC, etc)


???

fMRIPrep takes in a task-based or resting-state functional MRI dataset in BIDS-format and returns preprocessed data ready for analysis.

Some extras that it will leverage include: T2w, field maps and slice timing information

--

### *fMRIPrep* was created for fully-developed brains
* Relies on atlases generated by averaging 18-44y brains.
* Many default options are tweaked and tested for adult data.

???

Designed for general image processing, but tested mostly on adults.

--
* Neonate brain size and rapidly changing tissue contrasts present problems.

Snapshot of brains across development.
Not only size, but notice the reduction in T1w contrast until after 6 months.

Infrastructure - low-level interfaces (e.g., data access to images and spatial transforms) and utilities (see Figure 1).
Middleware: These utilities cover foundational processing methodologies and are generally reusable across end-user tools
End user: The user-facing applications held together by everything below them!
